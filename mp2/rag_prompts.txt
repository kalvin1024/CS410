Document 745: aeroelastic problems in connection with high speed flight . a review is given of developments in the field of aeroelasticity during the past ten years .  the effect of steadily increasing mach number has been two-fold ..  on the one hand the aerodynamic derivatives have changed, and in some cases brought new problems, and on the other hand the design for higher mach numbers has led to thinner aerofoils and more slender fuselages for which the required stiffness is more difficult to provide .  both these aspects are discussed, and various methods of attack on the problems are considered .  the relative merits of stiffness, damping and massbalance for the prevention of control surface flutter are discussed .  a brief mention is made of the recent problems of damage from jet efflux and of the possible aeroelastic effects of kinetic heating .

Document 91: the analysis of redundant structures by the use of high-speed digital computers . large-scale redundant structure analyses are currently feasible by the use of modern high-speed digital computers . this capability opportunely meets the urgent need to solve complex problems which otherwise would be hopelessly beyond the capacity of the hand desk computer .  however, the difficulties have now shifted from tedious hand computations to the problems of adequately representing the structure by a model and of the peculiarities of irregular geometrical configurations . a wide scope of problem types can be handled by a generalized program approach .  matrix formulation is used for the organization of input data and for handling data transfer in the large complex of subroutines, including the formation of equilibrium and continuity conditions to the final loads and deflections . simultaneous treatment of thermal expansions and plasticity is included . the use of minimum-size redundant systems is emphasized, starting from the philosophy of cutting members to provide a statically determinate structure .  improved numerical accuracy and problem size capacity is gained for a given computer . examples are discussed ranging from simple plane-load diffusion problems to pressurized fuselage cutouts and complex wing-fuselage-shell intersection-type problems .

Document 46: analysis of low-aspect-ratio aircraft structures . two methods are presented for the analysis of complex low- aspect-ratio aircraft structures .  both methods provide for arbitrary external loading, are general with respect to the orientation of structural members, and permit arbitrary boundary conditions .  for purposes of analysis a structure is idealized as a network of flexural members with interconnected torsion boxes . in the first method, sets of linear equations are obtained by expressing boundary conditions, member deflection equations, equilibrium requirements, and slope-compatibility relationships in terms of deflections and internal forces .  the solution for deflections and internal forces is then formed as the product of an inverse structural matrix and a column matrix of load functions . in the second method, the conditions at a given boundary are assembled as a column matrix and are transferred in a step by-step fashion over the entire structure to an opposite boundary . the transfer is accomplished by successive multiplications of square matrices composed independently for the different transfer ranges .  the final operation is the inversion of a relatively small matrix and provides the solution for the unknown boundary conditions . comparisons of theoretical results with experimental data and electric-analog solutions are favorable .

Document 51: procedure for calculating flutter at high supersonic speed including camber deflections, and comparison with experimental results . a method which may be used at high supersonic mach numbers is described for calculating the flutter speed of wings having camber in their deflection modes .  the normal coupled vibration modes of the wing are used to derive the equations of motion .  chord deflections of the vibration modes are approximated by polynomials .  the wing may have a control surface and may carry external stores although no aerodynamic forces on the stores are presented .  the aerodynamic forces that are assumed to be acting on the wing are obtained from piston theory and also from a quasi-steady form of a theory for two-dimensional steady flow .  airfoil shape and thickness effects are taken account of in the analysis . the method is used to calculate the flutter speed of some wings which had been previously tested at mach numbers of 1.3 to 3.0 . comparison of the calculations and experiment is made for flat-plate 60 and 45 delta wings and also for an untapered 45 sweptback wing .

Document 1293: non-linear shallow shell analysis by the matrix force method . the matrix force method of redundant structure analysis is currently being extended by various users to cover a number of non-linear problems . one of these is the non-linear analysis of heated cambered wings, such as might be used in advanced flight vehicles . in this case the approach used by the present authors is equally applicable to shallow shells, the formulation of the strain-displacement and equilibrium relations being a finite element equivalent to that used by marguerre .  the solution is obtained by a combined iteration and step by step procedure utilizing a tangent flexibility matrix .  divergence in the calculations indicates that the range of stable configurations has been exceeded .  cambered plates subjected to several loadings are given as examples,. for one, an exact solution is available for comparison . it is believed that the basic concepts involved in this shallow shell analysis can be extended to apply to other, more general shell instability problems, and that useful solutions to the latter are probably within the capability of present day digital computers .

Document 752: development of a quasi-steady approach to flutter and correlation with kernel-function results . the quasi-steady approach to flutter utilizes experimental or theoretical steady-state aerodynamic data to arrive at increased understanding of the flutter mechanism, and also, in many cases, acceptably accurate quantitative flutter predictions . circulation lag effects are neglected, but aerodynamic damping is included in the evaluation of the air forces .  situations requiring the inclusion of rate aerodynamics for accurate flutter estimation are specified . a quasi-unsteady approach is also discussed, in which the approximate magnitude of the circulation lag function at flutter is included in simple modifications of quasi-steady parameters . closed-form solutions are derived for the flutter characteristics of a typical section with and without rate aerodynamics . application is then made to the rational flutter analysis of three-dimensional multi-degree-of-freedom lifting surfaces . a specific planform is evaluated in the mach-number range from zero to two .  quasi-steady, quasi-unsteady, and kernel-function results are compared subsonically .  quasi-steady results are utilized supersonically . primary applications of the quasi-steady approach are in the areas of preliminary design and parameter-variation studies, modification of more sophisticated flutter theories to force compatibility with available steady-state data, and flutter evaluation of complex configurations which can be rationally analyzed by steady-state aerodynamic theories, but for which no complete unsteady aerodynamic theories are presently available .
